Data Analysis for Fluorescence Intensity Decay

These softwares are used to fit FLUORESCENCE INTENSITY DECAY DATA. Basically fluorescence intensity decays exponentially I (in ns time scale) with either one exponential or more than one exponential.

I(t) = I0 exp(-t/tau) where tau is fluorescence lifetime and k = 1/tau the decay constant FOR ONE EXP DECAY

For multiexp decay
I(t) = SIGMA (i =1 to n) ai.exp(-t/taui) where SIGMA ai = 1.0 and n = 1-3
